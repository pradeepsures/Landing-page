          <h1>What is artificial intelligence</h1>
          <p>Artificial intelligence (AI) is the theory and development of computer systems 
            capable of performing tasks that historically required human intelligence, 
            such as recognizing speech, making decisions, and identifying patterns. 
            AI is an umbrella term that encompasses a wide variety of technologies, 
            including machine learning, deep learning, and natural language processing (NLP). 
            Although the term is commonly used to describe a range of different technologies 
            in use today, many disagree on whether these actually constitute artificial 
            intelligence. Instead, some argue that much of the technology used in the real 
            world today actually constitutes highly advanced machine learning that is simply a 
            first step towards true artificial intelligence, or “general artificial 
            intelligence” (GAI).
             Yet, despite the many philosophical disagreements over whether “true” intelligent
             machines actually exist, when most people use the term AI today, they’re 
             referring to a suite of machine learning-powered technologies, such as Chat GPT 
             or computer vision, that enable machines to perform tasks that previously only 
             humans can do like generating written content, steering a car, or analyzing data...
